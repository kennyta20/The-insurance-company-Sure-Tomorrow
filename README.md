# The-insurance-company-Sure-Tomorrow
Sure Tomorrow, an insurance company, aims to leverage machine learning to optimize its operations and improve customer experiences. The project involves evaluating the feasibility of four key tasks: identifying customers similar to a given customer to enhance targeted marketing efforts, predicting the likelihood of a new customer receiving insurance benefits, estimating the number of benefits using a linear regression model, and implementing a data masking algorithm to protect personal information without compromising model performance. These initiatives aim to enhance predictive accuracy, safeguard sensitive data, and support informed decision-making, aligning with Sure Tomorrowâ€™s commitment to innovation and customer-centric solutions.
